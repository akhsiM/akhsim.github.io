Hi, my name is Misha Nguyen. You may also know me as Quang.

I am a software developer, whose specialty and interest lies in building backend systems and data transformation pipelines.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, cycling, badminton, and movies.

I enjoy working on myself, as much as I do learning. In learning, I enjoy Tech, Software, Data and Machine Learning as much as I do Philosophy and Psychology.
