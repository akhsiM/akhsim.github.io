## Hello, world ðŸ‘‹

This article is likely going to be my first ever "blog post". So in a ceremonial fashion I am going to spend one paragraph writing about the motivation behind this.

I have recently started noticing that the energy expenditure numbers, tracked by my smartwatch, have been down-trending. I have "complained" to my better half about it at least twice. When I complain about something too much, I tend to get bitter very quickly, so I decided to actually read about it. One of the facts that I learned is that "fitness improves economy of movement", meaning that as I become a better and stronger cyclist, I am able to ride for longer, faster whilst burning less energy per unit of activity. From a very lazy and slightly bitter lens to the world, it's terrible because it means I'd need to actually work out more. To be honest, I both hate and love that. But right this very moment, after a weird and chaotic day at work, I am hating it a bit more. 

So, let's rephrase that a little in a simpler format. As you get into the habit of regular exercising, you'll need to do more exercising, just to get the same output in energy expenditure. Exercising has a self-reinforcing mechanism.

When anything has a self-reinforcing mechanism, the actual mechanic that drives it is called a Positive Feedback Loop. This concept exists in multiple disciplines. It drives cool phenomenons.

## Positive Feedback Loop ðŸ”„

In a lifestyle context, a positive feedback loop can drive addiction. Any kind of addiction. Alcohol, gaming, cannabis, coffee..etc. In a psychology context, it can be a contributing force to panic attacks. In a weather context, a big enough bushfire can generate its own weather, including lightnings and thunderstorms that in turn generate more fires. Pretty sure this happened in Australia a few years ago. It's cool isn't it.

Most of these things are bad, but are they really, Positive Feedback Loop sounds kinda bad, but is it actually, or is it actually the monkey brain that we all have, that always tends to recognise the "bad" things easier ðŸ™‚. 

Of course, lest not forget, we learned thousand of years ago from Socrates that nothing is intrinsically good nor bad. Positive Feedback Loop is the same. It an underlying force of nature. Don't think too much about the meta of it, just enough to leverage it.

On the other side of the imaginary good-bad spectrum, Positive Feedback Loop is also the force that underlies compound interest in the realm of investing. Within the fitness context of what I am writing about, I will just call it "move more", as in you should move more. Not only that you'll get better at moving around, you'll also be conditioned in different ways to move more, meaning that the initial momentum needed to move, gets less and less over time.

Isn't it a bit cool how something as negatively sounding as "addiction", when explored thoughtfully, can also be leveraged to build wealth, and to improve personal fitness?

The question now is how. How does one gets aboard the PFL train, that doesn't stop. That's for another day. As a person with self-diagnosed ADHD, I do have a bit of personal experience with addiction ðŸ™‚, and a lot of that is applicable in the context of how to "enter" the loop. But also as a person with self-diagnosed ADHD, I am also incredibly lazy. So I will stop writing right this very moment.
