## What is an ETF?

ETF stands for Exchange-Traded Fund. An ETF is a collection of securities, such as bonds or stocks. ETFs offers investors a way to pool their money into a fund that invests in an underlying asset and then receive their stake in that pool. ETF shareholders are entitled to a portion of the profit, such as earned interest or dividends. They may also get the residual value in the event that the fund is liquidated.

ETFs work very much like mutual funds, which are baskets of securities that are chosen and maintained according to a particular movement strategy. What is this movement strategy? An ETF often tracks an underlying index. A popular example would be the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index.

The special thing about ETF is that ETF shares are bought and shared on the open stock market. Just like an ordinary stock, an ETF has a ticker symbol. This allows agility because individual investors can monitor and respond to the market in real time. Unlike the traditional mutual funds that can only be traded once a day after the market closes, ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold. This is why, generally, ETFs are considered to have more liquidity than traditional mutual funds.

The beauty of ETFs is that they allow investors to buy a variety of assets at once. ETFs can contain many types of investments including stocks, bonds, foreign currencies, even gold bars or oil futures. It is important to note, however, that investors only need to execute one transaction to buy (and sell) an ETF, without having to buy (or sell) each individual security. This makes ETF more attractive because this way, the diversity that it offers does not incur additional broker commission fees.

## What is a LIC?

LIC stands for Listed Investment Company. A LIC is an investment listed on a stock exchange that is incorporated as a company. They are first created by an Initial Public Offering (IPO) where money is raised and a fixed number of shares are created for each investors. The money raised is then used to invest in different assets which together make up the NAV of the LIC, minus liabilities.

In comparison to ETFs that are younger and more explosive in the recent years, LICs have been around for almost 100 years and are considered as an "older" form of investment.

Most LICs operate like a managed fund as there is a manager who operates its investments. Unlike managed funds, LICs have a company structure, which allows them to buy shares in the company.

A LIC is a company on the share market whose business is to invest in other companies on the share market and grow their portfolio. By buying a LIC's shares, investors will have a team that actively manage their money. Each LIC has its own management team whose responsibility is to choose the company's investments and managing them. The value of the LIC is reflected in how successful the company is at investing.

Generally, each LIC has a unique objective and strategy that is usually reflected in their portfolios and underlying assets. Typically, they will look for companies that meet their specific mandate based on different attributes, like dividend yields.

LICs may vary in term of investment approaches. Some LICs are more aggressive and may focus on capital gains, where as some other LICs are more passive and may focus on a steady stream of income, like dividends. 

# Net Asset Value (NAV)

## ETF and Market Makers

The NAV of an ETF represents the value of each share's portion of the fund's underlying assets and leftover cash, subtracting any liabilities at the end of trading day. Although ETF's market price may fluctuate during trading hours from investor' activities, the NAV of ETFs are calculated after markets close at 4.00PM Eastern Time. Although it sounds like the market price of an ETF may differ from its NAV, the deviations, if any should be relatively minor and negligible. 

**This is due to ETF's redemption mechanism.**

What is a redemption mechanism? This is a method used by ETF market makers to reconcile differences between NAV and market values. Throughout a trading day, it is natural that deviations occur between NAV and the trading price of an ETF. However, these Market Makers, or  Authorized Participants, would jump in and simultaneously buy and sell ETF units to make themselves a profit. These groups earn their profit from ETF arbitraging and will do it until the fund is restored back its fund value, ensuring an ETF's tight tracking of its index. 

Who are Market Makers? These are Authorised Participants whose task is to provide ETF liquidity to a given market. They do this by simultaneously selling the ETF units at an asking prices and posting bid prices to purchase units. In return they earn the profit in arbitraging the prices. When an investor buys (and sells) and ETF they are transacting with the Market Maker behind the scene. Due to the present of a market makers, it is not possible to buy ETFs at a discount price.

It is important to understand the market maker's role and the redemption mechanism because ETF is essentially a three-way partnership that is profitable to all parties. The market maker and the redemption mechanism are also the driving force for a lot of advantages that are associated with ETFs.

## LIC

The topic of NAV for LIC is relatively less complicated than ETF because LIC is a company. Hence the NAV just represents the net value of the LIC i.e assets minus liabilities.

There are no market makers in LICs and investors buy and sell the shares on the market with each other. The NAV of a LIC may have a non-negligible deviation with its share price on the market. Due to this reason, it is possible to buy LICs at a discount (cheaper than NAV) or premium (more expensive than NAV).

# Open-ended vs. Close-ended

This is a key difference between ETFs and LICs.

**LICs are closed-ended funds.** For any given LIC, the number of share units on the market is fixed. This is similar to any company that is listed on an exchange. Any surge in demand for a specific LIC would not create any more shares on the market for that LIC, although it would have an impact on the market price. The only way for new shares to come onto the market is by the company issuing new shares through corporate action such as capital raising. However this only happen once in a while.

This is why the market price of a LIC can deviate from its underlying NAV, which enables investors to trade share at a premium, or discount. An investor should use a LIC's NAV as a reference point to know the true value of one unit or share. When they compare market price to this reference point, investors can then determine if the fund is trading at a premium or discount. If the price is higher than the NAV, then the unit or share is trading at a premium. Conversely if the market price is lower than the NAV, the unit or share is trading at a discount.

Due to the nature of being a closed-ended fund, the liquidity of a LIC will depend on both the number of buyers and sellers as well as the demand for the share or unit.

**ETFs are open-ended funds.** There is no limit to the number of units for any ETF. As new investors buy it, new units are created. Similarly if investors exit, then the units can be cancelled. The fund grows and contracts based on investor activity and investment returns. This is thanks to the above mentioned market makers. As investors transact with the market makers, the price of each unit will be very close to the underlying NAV, not what the market thinks it's worth.

**In time of crisis, the difference can be key.** For ETFs, if the majority of investors want to cash out, the fund will have to come up with a way to get the cash. This may mean that the fund would have to sell its assets to give investors their money. For LICs, the company does not have to meet its demand. The market worries about supply & demand whereas the company can focus on its sole mission which is to invest and make money. 

This is a key argument why many investors choose not go with ETFs. They can do very well in a "bullish" market, however things can get a bit uncertain if there is a sudden regulatory change or when the market is not so bullish.

# Management & Legal Structure

**ETFs use a trust structure whereas LICs use a company structure.**

ETFs issue units to investors where as LICs offer shares in its own company. LICs are only ever actively managed whereas there are different types of ETFs including passive and active management. 

Most ETFs track the performance of a market index and do not try to outperform the index. 

On the contrary, LICs' sole purpose is to outperform their respective indices. They rely on their own expertise of investment managers to pick stocks or other investments. They refer to the index as the benchmark and seek to outperform it. This is why LICs are called "actively managed". An important note about LICs is that although their aim is to outperform the market, there is no guarantee that the investment manager is able to meet this objective. 

**This is why generally, LICs are considered "more active" than ETFs.**

Due to LICs' company structure, they have a high degree of corporate governance and are legally required to maintain a board of directors and deliver annual and half-yearly reports.

The differences in their legal structure also has an important implication in ETF and LIC transparency. ETFs must disclose their portfolios at the end of each trading day, where as LICs only disclose their portfolio until a reporting deadline. The portfolio which is disclosed may already be out of date. As such, LIC investors do not have as much transparency as that of ETF investors.

# Management Expense Ratio (MER)

As ETFs are passively managed and they just aim to track an index, **ETF ongoing management fees are lower than LICs**. LICs' MERs may vary depending on the companies. However if we look at the older, more reputable LICs like Argo, AFI, Milton.. the highest MER is around 0.18%. If we look at some Australia index ETFs - Vanguard currently has a MER of 0.1% and Betashares A200 0.07%.

Both of these are considered lower MER investments anyway. The numbers above are pretty small.

Why should we pay for LIC's higher MER? When we buy a LIC share, we buy a piece of that company, however we are also paying for its skills, due diligence and expertise of a market watcher to outperform the index. 

# Dividends

Both ETFs are LICs offer dividends. However there is a fundamental difference.

ETFs are legally obligated to distribute all income it receives each year to investors in the form of dividends. LICs, however, distribute their income when the board declares a dividend. A LIC has the power to decide whether to pass its profit from dividends onto its shareholders or simply hold part of the fund. 

Although this can be frowned upon, what it ensures is that LIC share holders should theoretically have a steady stream of income. This is because LICs can hold on to the profits in the "good years" to compensate "the bad years", whereas the income from ETFs can be inconsistent and market-dependent. This is called the "smoothing" of income.
